# MarketingBenefits-UsesHJD
This is my week 1 challenge for my coding course


In this assignment I was tasked to refactor and clean the code  so it would go with best practice for semantics and be properly cleaned.
I made the following changes
Line 7-8: removed unnecessary 0 values of removed unnecessary padding/margin values of 0
Line 87-101: Consolidated various benefit classes to singular .benefit class
Line 103-155: Consolidated various classes(orm,smm,seo) into singular class .uses
